# Built with React.js | No Boilerplate
This is not built with <b>npx create-react-app</b><br>
I have used npm to install all necessary libaraies for React.js.<br>
I did it this way because I prefer to build from the group up, rather than use a tool to build it for me.

# Working On
Just lifted everything up..pulled function out of props for togglingDiv. Do the same for switching the data
thinking switch case and then setting the state of this.state({ data : <Component />})
