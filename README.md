# Built with React.js | No Boilerplate
This is not built with <b>npx create-react-app</b><br>
I have used npm to install all necessary libaraies for React.js.<br>
I did it this way because I prefer to build from the group up, rather than use a tool to build it for me.


# To Start (From Clone)
<ul>
    <li>npm install</li>
    <li>npm start</li>
</ul>

# Recent Changes
Usage of Function Components opposed to using Class Components. Usingn UseState instead of setting states in contructors.
Easier to read, more modern methods of arrow functions.
