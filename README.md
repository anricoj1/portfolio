# Built with React.js | No Boilerplate
This is not built with <b>npx create-react-app</b><br>
I have used npm to install all necessary libaraies for React.js.<br>
I did it this way because I prefer to build from the group up, rather than use a tool to build it for me.


# To Start (From Clone)

    <li>npm start</li>
</ul>
